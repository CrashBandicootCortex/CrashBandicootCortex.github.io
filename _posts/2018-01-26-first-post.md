GTA 5 for android allows user to experience the same game that you used to play on Xbox, Playstation or PC. If you had been playing GTA V before then you can continue the game just by logging in into your account. This is one of the best feature they have added recently.

That's why it was important for us to make android version of the game." Said Rockstar CEO. One of the biggest advantage of downloading GTA 5 apk is that you can carry the game with you.
