Download GTA V for iOS on your phone to play GTA 5 on bus, car, station, while waiting in line or even while walking (it's not suggested). Pedestrians mechanics are now different than other versions of the game. They are like real people walking on the road, they have same amount of fear and walks the same walk. They can been seen on bus stops in East Los Santos and same people can be seen working on lawns. The map is larger than any other Grand Theft Auto series which is about 27.5 square miles. Grand Theft Auto V has file size about 30 GB on other consoles. 30 GB is not possible on iOS devices so Rockstar decided to compress the game. Finally Grand Theft Auto 5 was about 4.2 GB including .ipa.
